Usage / Goals:
=============

* mvn hadoop:pack
------

Creates the jar file to be submitted to the hadoop job engine. 

The jar contains a directory called ./lib , that contains all the dependent jars in the same. 
The classes of the current project are also available in the same. 

The jar would be created in $basedir/target/hadoop-deploy/${artifact.name}-{artifact.version}-hdeploy.jar. 

Once created, this could be started with the hadoop jar engine. 

$ $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar  $basedir/target/hadoop-deploy/${artifact.name}-{artifact.version}-hdeploy.jar   job.launching.class

* mvn hadoop:deploy
--------

Deploys the packed job to the given path on hdfs.
